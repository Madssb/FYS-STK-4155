# Project 1
This is the home for sourcecode pertaining to the first project of FYS-STK4155.
Results may be reproduced by executing main.py, i.e. running 
`python3.11 main.py`.

`utility.py` contains the franke function, and other "quality of life" 
functions that prove useful for generating figures. 
`model_evaluation_metrics.py` contains MSE, R2, variance, and bias computing
functions for use in `regression.py`, and `regression.py` contains the methods
for OLS, Ridge, and Lasso regression, and alternatives for analysing their
outputs.
`figs/` contain several subfolders for where plots generated with `main.py` are saved.
